I am an academic technologist and librarian focusing on supporting researchers in the digital humanities and social sciences. I consult and collaborate on a variety of digital scholarship projects. Currently, I am the Digital Scholarship Coordinator based jointly in Stanford University's Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis and Stanford Libraries' Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research. Before that, I was a Program Manager at the UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley campus, and previously the Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of Michigan Library, where I earned my MSI.
