I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="https://www.polisci.washington.edu/">Political Science at the University of Washington</a>. My work lies at the intersection of comparative and international political economy and political methodology, focusing on the causes of political regime shifts and their consequences on economic policies and institutions. My work has appeared in peer-reviewed journals, including \textit{Perspectives on Politics}.
