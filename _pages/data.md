### Job Market Paper
**Democracy and Macroprudential Banking Regulation**


[<a href="javascript:showhide('jmp')">Abs</a>]

<div id="jmp" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  Do democracies implement more banking regulations than authoritarian states? Existing studies examine the relationship between democracy and financial development and banking crises, but we lack an understanding of how political regimes influence banking regulations. Examining the increased global focus on macroprudential policy, which preemptively restricts credit expansion to decrease the risk and magnitude of banking crises, I argue that democratic countries limit regulatory implementation. Because the difficulty of retrospective evaluation of macroprudential policies exacerbates the short-termism of democratic decision-making, and the heterogeneous distributional effects of regulation increase the transaction costs of veto bargaining, democratic countries tend to resist reform and maintain status quo regulatory systems. Empirically, a panel dataset of macroprudential policies in 126 countries from 1990-2020 and case studies of the United States, China, and Hungary indicate robust empirical support for the democratic disadvantage of macroprudential regulations. </div> </p></div>

<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  We explore the US states’ evolving policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by examining governors’ decisions to begin easing five types of social distancing policies after the initial case surge in March–April 2020. Applying event history models to original data on state COVID-19 policies, we test the relative influence of health, economic, and political considerations on their decisions. We find no evidence that differences in state economic conditions influenced when governors began easing. Governors of states with larger recent declines in COVID-19 deaths per capita and improving trends in new confirmed cases and test positivity were quicker to ease. However, politics played as powerful a role as epidemiological conditions, driven primarily by governors’ party affiliation. Republican governors made the policy U-turn from imposing social distancing measures toward easing those measures a week earlier than Democratic governors, all else equal. Most troubling of all, we find that states with larger Black populations eased their social distancing policies more quickly, despite Black Americans’ higher exposure to infection from SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent death from COVID-19. </div> </p></div>

<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  How can scholars conduct field research when there is limited access to the field? This article first identifies how limited and uncertain field access can affect field research and then provides recommendations to address these challenges. We focus on conducting field research in Japan because of our substantive expertise, but we believe that the problems and solutions outlined in this article are applicable to a broad range of countries. Our hope is that this article contributes to the developing literature on conducting research during times of emergency and to the larger literature on best practices for field research. </div> </p></div>



[2] **Governor Partisanship Explains the Adoption of Statewide Mandates to Wear Face Coverings**

<div id="pr2" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  Public mask use has emerged as a key tool in response to COVID-19. We develop a classification of statewide mask mandates that reveals variation in their scope and timing. Some US states quickly mandated wearing of face coverings in most public spaces, whereas others issued narrow mandates or no mandate at all. We consider how differences in COVID-19 epidemiological indicators and partisan politics affect when states adopted broad mask mandates, starting with the earliest mandates in April 2020 and continuing through the end of 2020. The most important predictor is the presence of a Republican governor, delaying statewide indoor mask mandates an estimated 98.0 days on average. COVID-19 indicators such as confirmed case or death rates are much less important predictors. This finding highlights a key challenge to public efforts to increase mask wearing, one of the most effective tools for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while restoring economic activity. </div> </p></div>

<div id="pr1" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  <bold>Context:</bold> Social distancing is an essential but economically painful measure to flatten the curve of emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government left to the states the difficult and consequential decisions about when to cancel events, close schools and businesses, and issue stay-at-home orders.<br>

</bold>Methods:</bold> The authors present an original, detailed dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic; they then apply event history analysis to study the timing of implementation of five social distancing policies across all 50 states.<br>

<bold>Results:</bold> The most important predictor of when states adopted social distancing policies is political: all else equal, states led by Republican governors were slower to implement such policies during a critical window of early COVID-19 response.<br>

<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Continuing actions driven by partisanship rather than by public health expertise and scientific recommendations may exact greater tolls on health and broader society. </div> </p></div>

<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  Highly accommodative monetary policy during nine years of Abenomics allowed fiscal expansion to become the center of the Japanese government’s COVID-19 stimulus and the further economic measures were the primary issue facing the 2021 Lower House Election. Under monetary constraints, the economic policy choice among Japan’s conventional growth strategy, distribution, and fiscal discipline creates trilemma, where the government can pursue only two of these three goals. In this election, the LDP-Komeito coalition managed to straddle between distribution and growth strategy, while exploiting policy space for the opposition parties. Although the coalition maintained the electoral majority, the inroad made by Ishin, Reiwa, and the Democratic Party for the People whose campaigns neglected fiscal discipline in favor of both growth and distribution foreshadows the challenge against the Japanese government’s future fiscal health. </div> </p></div>
