	<p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  This thesis investigates Bayesian inference over time series models with the emphasis put on applications in economics and finance. We adopt simulation-based techniques which are necessary in any nontrival problem in this setting. The main motivation behind the presented research is to increase the effciency and accuracy of these computationally intensive methods in several different contexts. One of the main topics addressed is efficient and precise risk estimation, or rare event analysis. Another problem studied in this thesis is the efficiency of various sampling algorithms, in particular importance sampling (IS) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Finally, we address the issue of  forecasting, from a single model as well as from a combination of models. </div> </p>
