### Job Market Paper
**Democracy and Macroprudential Banking Regulation**


[<a href="javascript:showhide('jmp')">Abs</a>]
[<a href="/assets/pdf/20221025Draft">PDF</a>]
<div id="jmp" style="display:block;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  Do democracies implement more banking regulations than authoritarian states? Existing studies examine the relationship between democracy and financial development and banking crises, but we lack an understanding of how political regimes influence banking regulations. Examining the increased global focus on macroprudential policy, which preemptively restricts credit expansion to decrease the risk and magnitude of banking crises, I argue that democratic countries limit regulatory implementation. Because the difficulty of retrospective evaluation of macroprudential policies exacerbates the short-termism of democratic decision-making, and the heterogeneous distributional effects of regulation increase the transaction costs of veto bargaining, democratic countries tend to resist reform and maintain status quo regulatory systems. Empirically, a panel dataset of macroprudential policies in 126 countries from 1990-2020 and case studies of the United States, China, and Hungary indicate robust empirical support for the democratic disadvantage of macroprudential regulations. </div> </p></div>

<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  We explore the US states’ evolving policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by examining governors’ decisions to begin easing five types of social distancing policies after the initial case surge in March–April 2020. Applying event history models to original data on state COVID-19 policies, we test the relative influence of health, economic, and political considerations on their decisions. We find no evidence that differences in state economic conditions influenced when governors began easing. Governors of states with larger recent declines in COVID-19 deaths per capita and improving trends in new confirmed cases and test positivity were quicker to ease. However, politics played as powerful a role as epidemiological conditions, driven primarily by governors’ party affiliation. Republican governors made the policy U-turn from imposing social distancing measures toward easing those measures a week earlier than Democratic governors, all else equal. Most troubling of all, we find that states with larger Black populations eased their social distancing policies more quickly, despite Black Americans’ higher exposure to infection from SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent death from COVID-19. </div> </p></div>

<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  How can scholars conduct field research when there is limited access to the field? This article first identifies how limited and uncertain field access can affect field research and then provides recommendations to address these challenges. We focus on conducting field research in Japan because of our substantive expertise, but we believe that the problems and solutions outlined in this article are applicable to a broad range of countries. Our hope is that this article contributes to the developing literature on conducting research during times of emergency and to the larger literature on best practices for field research. </div> </p></div>

<div id="pr2" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  Public mask use has emerged as a key tool in response to COVID-19. We develop a classification of statewide mask mandates that reveals variation in their scope and timing. Some US states quickly mandated wearing of face coverings in most public spaces, whereas others issued narrow mandates or no mandate at all. We consider how differences in COVID-19 epidemiological indicators and partisan politics affect when states adopted broad mask mandates, starting with the earliest mandates in April 2020 and continuing through the end of 2020. The most important predictor is the presence of a Republican governor, delaying statewide indoor mask mandates an estimated 98.0 days on average. COVID-19 indicators such as confirmed case or death rates are much less important predictors. This finding highlights a key challenge to public efforts to increase mask wearing, one of the most effective tools for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while restoring economic activity. </div> </p></div>

<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  <bold>Context:</bold> Social distancing is an essential but economically painful measure to flatten the curve of emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government left to the states the difficult and consequential decisions about when to cancel events, close schools and businesses, and issue stay-at-home orders.<br>

</bold>Methods:</bold> The authors present an original, detailed dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic; they then apply event history analysis to study the timing of implementation of five social distancing policies across all 50 states.<br>

<bold>Results:</bold> The most important predictor of when states adopted social distancing policies is political: all else equal, states led by Republican governors were slower to implement such policies during a critical window of early COVID-19 response.<br>

<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Continuing actions driven by partisanship rather than by public health expertise and scientific recommendations may exact greater tolls on health and broader society. </div> </p></div>

<div id="bc1" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  Highly accommodative monetary policy during nine years of Abenomics allowed fiscal expansion to become the center of the Japanese government’s COVID-19 stimulus and the further economic measures were the primary issue facing the 2021 Lower House Election. Under monetary constraints, the economic policy choice among Japan’s conventional growth strategy, distribution, and fiscal discipline creates trilemma, where the government can pursue only two of these three goals. In this election, the LDP-Komeito coalition managed to straddle between distribution and growth strategy, while exploiting policy space for the opposition parties. Although the coalition maintained the electoral majority, the inroad made by Ishin, Reiwa, and the Democratic Party for the People whose campaigns neglected fiscal discipline in favor of both growth and distribution foreshadows the challenge against the Japanese government’s future fiscal health. </div> </p></div>


### Work in Progress
[1] **Democracy and Economic Development: A Time-Varying Parameter Model**
_Chapter 2 of Dissertation_


[<a href="javascript:showhide('wp1')">Abs</a>]
<div id="wp1" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  Revisiting a controversy on the relationship between economic development and democratization, this paper explores dynamic relationships using a new estimation methodology with time-varying parameter (TVP) models.  I argue that the emergence of instituitoalized autocracies after the collapse of the Soviet Union exerts a structural change in the relationship between economic growth and democratization, predicting that the marginal effect of income on the transition to democracy diminishes over time.  The empirical analysis confirms that the magnitude of influence of per capita income on democratization is stable during the period from the 1960s to the 1980s, while it declines in the 1990s and the early 2000s. Moreover, the result shows that the time-varying effect of income is always positive and statistically significant in all periods, suggesting the modernization theory stands up well. </div> </p></div>

[2]  **Democracy-at-Risk:  Estimating Vulnerability and Resilience of Democracy**
_Chapter 3 of Dissertation_


[<a href="javascript:showhide('wp2')">Abs</a>]
<div id="wp2" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">  What causes democratic regression and consolidation? Several previous studies examine political polarization, economic development and shocks, and international factors to explain democratic backsliding. These studies usually provide point estimates for the conditional mean of democratic indexes and other variables considered causal factors, assuming the distribution of risks around the estimation is normally distributed. However, this approach underestimates the possibility that the upsides and downsides of democratic risks are uneven. Revisiting the modernization theory and distributive conflict theory, I explore the risks of democratic vulnerability and resilience and their association with two economic drivers— income levels and income distribution— with a large sample of advanced and emerging market economies from 1980 to 2017. To investigate the risk these factors pose to democracy, I employ quantile regressions to focus on tail risks for democratic regression and consolidation. This empirical strategy allows us to quantify the chance of a very high or low shift of democracy indexes when the tail risks develop differently from average outcomes. I find that upside and downside democracy risks are symmetric as these risks are fallen when GDP per capita increases, suggesting that regime stability increases at any level of the democracy index. However, widening income inequality increases the tail risk of democratic regression while lowering inequality does not affect the upside risk of democracy. </div> </p></div>

[3]  **Driving Forces of Diversification in Central Banks’ Functions: Global Textual Analysis of Central Bank Laws**

with Masaaki Higashijima

[<a href="javascript:showhide('wp3')">Abs</a>]
<div id="wp3" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> Why are some governments delegate more functions to their central bank than others? Despite the importance of non-monetary functions of central banks – issuance of legal tender banknotes, banking regulation, payment infrastructure provisions, reserve management –, little is known about the relationship between a variety of central bank functions and governments’ delegation strategies. The conventional wisdom of independent central banks considers that the narrower focus of central bank mandate on price stability, the better economic outcomes. However, no central bank operates only monetary policies, and delegating non-monetary functions has increased, especially after the Great Financial Crisis. To empirically capture the diversification of central bank mandates, we apply the Keyword Assisted Topic Models to the central bank statute of 103 countries. We analyze governments’ delegation strategies by focusing on a trade-off between central bank autonomy and the breadth of its policy functions. We suggest that governments are likely to allow broader policy roles to the central bank when countries are more autocratic and have lower state capacity. Our findings advance our understanding of when governments formally delegate certain political and economic powers to central banks. </div> </p></div>

[4]  **Economic Policy Trilemma and Longevity of a Political Party: A Study of Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party in a Comparative Perspective**

with Saori N. Katada

[<a href="javascript:showhide('wp4')">Abs</a>]
<div id="wp4" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> Democracies tend to experience changes in the governing party to adapt to the structural changes in international economic relations and domestic industrial developments, while some countries see a party stay in the governing position for a long time. Such longevity of a governing party is even more puzzling when the country struggles with economic stagnation like in the case of Japan since the mid-1990s. How has the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) managed to stay in power in economic hard times for so long? We argue that the LDP weakens opposition parties by co-opting their innovative policy proposals, thus exploiting the opposition parties’ own policy space and producing less competitive elections. In economic stagnation, the economic policy choice comes down to conventional growth strategy, distribution, and fiscal discipline, creating a trilemma where the government can pursue only two of these three goals. The LDP has managed to exploit policy space for the opposition parties under the trilemma. To empirically capture the changes in policy goals, we apply Keyword Assisted Topic Models to the economic policy debate data in the Diet from the late 1990s to 2022, quantifying the share of each policy goal in the debates. This study reveals the effectiveness of the LDP’s economic strategy in the face of economic policy trilemma, suggesting incumbent party’s co-optation strategies could lead to democratic erosion, with implications for other established democracies. </div> </p></div>


[5]  **Financial Crises and Political Liberalization**

with Bree Bang-Jensen and Brian Leung

[<a href="javascript:showhide('wp5')">Abs</a>]
<div id="wp5" style="display:none;">
<p><div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> The past decade has been characterized by two trends: the aftermath of the 2008-2009 recession and what some scholars characterize as a democratic regression. We explore whether financial crises leads states to become more authoritarian, and which state characteristics encourage stability.  Using financial crisis data from 1946-2010, we find that currency crises move states closer to authoritarianism but domestic sovereign debt crises lead to democratization.  We find that banking crises, the most dominant crisis during the 2008 recession, do not affect regime stability. Consolidated democracies are more resilient in times of crisis.  We argue that the types of constituents most directly impacted by certain economic crises lead to different responses by the regimes, resulting in either autocratization or democratization. This research suggests that the effect of financial crises on regime type is heterogeneous, and wealthier, more democratic countries are more resistant to authoritarianism in times of crisis.  </div> </p></div>
